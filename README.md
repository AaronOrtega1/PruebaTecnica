### Explanation

This project is a user profile page with different sections about skills, experience, and more. It features a minimalist yet modern design with a default dark theme and a color button to switch to a light theme. The selected theme is saved in local storage, so it doesn't reset to the default colors when the page is reloaded. Navigation buttons in the header allow users to move between different sections of the website. Each time the index page is reloaded, a modal appears, greeting the user. At the end, in the contact section, there is a functional comment form that stores the comments in the websiteâ€™s local storage. I chose to divide the different sections into separate pages on the website because it looks more dynamic than having all the information on just the index.html. Since I had already completed the HTML and CSS, it was easy to divide; I simply created new HTML files and assigned them separate CSS files.
